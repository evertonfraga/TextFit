TextFit - A simple jQuery plugin that will make your titles fit in one line.

Usage
=====

- Make sure your element(s) have a line-height set.
- Find out what is the minimum font size your element(s) will look good.
- Put this in a script tag:

$('.my-element').textFit({minFontSize: 20});


This still very alpha, and surely will present some misbehaviors
